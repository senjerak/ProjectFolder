            <p>Hey there, it's-a me, Luigi!<br> Most folks know me for my adventures in the Mushroom Kingdom, but
                there's
                more to my story
                than saving princesses and battling Goombas. Back in the day, I stumbled upon a new world... the world
                wide web.
                Intrigued by its super-duper potential, I decided to trade my trusty plunger for a different kind of
                tool... a
                computer. I plunged headfirst into the world of coding, HTML, CSS, and all those other fancy acronyms.
                My first attempt at
                building a website was like navigating through a Warp Pipe blindfolded. I may have confused pixels with
                mushrooms a few
                times, but hey, nobody said being a web artist was easy!</p>
